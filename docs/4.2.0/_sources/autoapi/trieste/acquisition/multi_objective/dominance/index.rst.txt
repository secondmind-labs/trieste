.. py:function:: non_dominated(observations: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

   Computes the non-dominated set for a set of data points. Based on:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32791911/fast-calculation-of-pareto-front-in-python

   If there are duplicate point(s) in the non-dominated set, this function will return
   as it is without removing the duplicate.

   :param observations: set of points with shape [N,D]
   :return: tf.Tensor of the non-dominated set [P,D] and a non-dominated point mask [N],
       P is the number of points in pareto front, the mask specifies whether each data point
       is non-dominated or not.
