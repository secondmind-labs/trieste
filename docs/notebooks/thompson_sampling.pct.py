# ## Define the problem and model
#
# You can use Thompson sampling for Bayesian optimization in much the same way as we used EGO and EI in the tutorial _Introduction_. Since the setup is much the same is in that tutorial, we'll skip over most of the detail.
#
# We'll use a continuous bounded search space, and evaluate the observer at ten random points.

num_initial_data_points = 10
initial_query_points = search_space.sample(num_initial_data_points)

# We'll use Gaussian process regression to model the function, as implemented in GPflow. The GPflow models cannot be used directly in our Bayesian optimization routines, so we build a GPflow's `GPR` model using Trieste's convenient model build function `build_gpr` and pass it to the `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper. Note that we set the likelihood variance to a small number because we are dealing with a noise-free problem.

# %%
from trieste.models.gpflow import GaussianProcessRegression, build_gpr


gpflow_model = build_gpr(initial_data, search_space, likelihood_variance=1e-7)
model = GaussianProcessRegression(gpflow_model)

# ## Create the Thompson sampling acquisition rule
#
# We achieve Bayesian optimization with Thompson sampling by specifying `DiscreteThompsonSampling` as the acquisition rule. Unlike the `EfficientGlobalOptimization` acquisition rule, `DiscreteThompsonSampling` does not use an acquisition function. Instead, in each optimization step, the rule samples `num_query_points` samples from the model posterior at `num_search_space_samples` points on the search space. It then returns the `num_query_points` points of those that minimise the model posterior.

# %%
num_search_space_samples = 1000
num_query_points = 10
acq_rule = trieste.acquisition.rule.DiscreteThompsonSampling(
    num_search_space_samples=num_search_space_samples,
    num_query_points=num_query_points,
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# All that remains is to pass the Thompson sampling rule to the `BayesianOptimizer`. Once the optimization loop is complete, the optimizer will return `num_query_points` new query points for every step in the loop. With five steps, that's fifty points.

# %%

num_steps = 5
result = bo.optimize(
    num_steps, initial_data, model, acq_rule, track_state=False

dataset = result.try_get_final_dataset()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Visualising the result
#
# We can take a look at where we queried the observer, both the original query points (crosses) and new query points (dots), and where they lie with respect to the contours of the Branin.
