# ## Describe the problem
# In this example, we look to find the minimum value of the two-dimensional Branin function over the hypercube $[0, 1]^2$. We can plot contours of the Branin over this space.

# ## Sample the observer over the search space
#
# Sometimes we don't have direct access to the objective function. We only have an observer that indirectly observes it. In _Trieste_, the observer outputs a number of datasets, each of which must be labelled so the optimization process knows which is which. In our case, we only have one dataset, the objective. We'll use _Trieste_'s default label for single-model setups, `OBJECTIVE`. We can convert a function with `branin`'s signature to a single-output observer using `mk_observer`.
#
# The optimization procedure will benefit from having some starting data from the objective function to base its search on. We sample five points from the search space and evaluate them on the observer. We can represent the search space using a `Box`.

# %%

num_initial_points = 5
initial_query_points = search_space.sample(num_initial_points)
initial_data = observer(initial_query_points)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model the objective function
#
# The Bayesian optimization procedure estimates the next best points to query by using a probabilistic model of the objective. We'll use Gaussian process regression for this, provided by GPflow. The model will need to be trained on each step as more points are evaluated, so we'll package it with GPflow's Scipy optimizer.
#
# Note we could leave it to the optimizer to build this model, but we'll want to inspect it later so we'll build it ourselves.
#
# Just like the data output by the observer, the optimization process assumes multiple models, so we'll need to label the model in the same way.

# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# We can now run the Bayesian optimization loop by defining a `BayesianOptimizer` and calling its `optimize` method.
#
# The optimizer uses an acquisition rule to choose where in the search space to try on each optimization step. We'll use the default acquisition rule, which is Efficient Global Optimization with Expected Improvement.
#
# We'll run the optimizer for fifteen steps.
#
# The `optimize` method returns several things (see the `optimize` documentation for details), but we're only interested in the data, which captures the points where the objective was queried and the resulting values. Note that the optimizer updates the model in place.
#
# However, since the optimization loop catches errors so as not to lose progress, we must check if any errors occurred so we know the data is valid. We'll do that crudely here by re-raising any such errors. You may wish instead to use the history to restore the process from an earlier point.

# # Try an alternative acquisition function

# %% [markdown]
# By default, Trieste uses Expected Improvement (EI) as its acqusition function when performing Bayesian optimization. However, many alternative acqusition functions have been developed. One such alternative is Max-value Entropy Search (MES), which approximates the distribution of current estimate of the global minimum and tries to decrease its entropy with each optimization step.

# %% [markdown]
# We plot these two acquisition functions across our search space. Areas with high acquisition function scores (i.e bright regions) are those rated as promising locations for the next evaluation of our objective function. We see that EI wishes to continue exploring the search space, whereas MES wants to focus resources on evaluating a specific region.
