# # Mixed search spaces
#
# This notebook demonstrates optimization of mixed search spaces in Trieste.
#
# The example function is defined over 2D input space that is a combination of a
# discrete and a continuous search space. The problem is a modification of the Branin function
# where one of the input dimensions is discretized.

# ## The problem
#
# The Branin function is a common optimization benchmark that has three global minima. It is normally
# defined over a 2D continuous search space.
#
# We first show the Branin function over its original continuous search space.

# %% [markdown]
# In order to convert the Branin function from a continuous to a mixed search space problem, we
# modify it by discretizing its first input dimension.
#
# The discrete dimension is defined by a set of 10 points that are equally spaced, ensuring that
# the three minimizers are included in this set. The continuous dimension is defined by the
# interval [0, 1].
#
# We observe that the first and third minimizers are equidistant from the middle minimizer, so we
# choose the discretization points to be equally spaced around the middle minimizer.
#
# The `TaggedProductSearchSpace` class is a convenient way to define a search space
# that is a combination of multiple search spaces, each with an optional tag.
# We create our mixed search space by instantiating this class with a list containing the discrete
# and continuous spaces, without any explicit tags (hence using default tags).
# This can be easily extended to more than two search spaces by adding more elements to the list.

# ## Sample the observer over the search space
#
# We begin our optimization by first collecting five function evaluations from random locations in

# Observe that the `sample` method deals with the mixed search space automatically.

# ## Model the objective function
#
# We now build a Gaussian process model of the objective function using the initial data, similar
# to the [introduction notebook](expected_improvement.ipynb).
#
# Since all of the data in this example is quantitative, the model does not differentiate between
# the discrete and continuous dimensions of the search space. The Gaussian process regression model
# treats all dimensions as continuous variables, allowing for a seamless integration of both types
# of dimensions in the optimization process.

# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# The Bayesian optimization loop is run for 15 steps over the mixed search space.
# For each step, the optimizer fixes the discrete dimension to the best points found from a random
# initial search, and then optimizes the continuous dimension using a gradient-based method.
# This dispatch of discrete and continuous optimization is handled by the optimizer automatically.

# ## Trust region with mixed search spaces
#
# In this section, we demonstrate the use of trust region acquisition rules with mixed search
# spaces. We use the same mixed search space and observer as before, and the same initial data.
# See [trust region Bayesian optimization notebook](trust_region.ipynb) for an introduction to
# trust region acquisition rules.

# First we build a Gaussian process model of the objective function using the initial data.

# We create a trust region acquisition rule that uses the efficient global optimization (EGO)
# acquisition rule as the base rule. The trust region acquisition rule is initialized with a set of
# trust regions; 5 in this example. Each trust regions is defined as a product of a discrete and a
# continuous trust sub-region. The base rule is then used to optimize the acquisition function
# within each trust region. This setup is analogous to the one used in the "Batch trust region rule"
# section of the [trust region Bayesian optimization notebook](trust_region.ipynb).
