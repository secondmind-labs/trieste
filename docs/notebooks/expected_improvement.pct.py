# ## Describe the problem
# In this example, we look to find the minimum value of the two-dimensional Branin function over the hypercube $[0, 1]^2$. We can represent the search space using a `Box`, and plot contours of the Branin over this space.

# ## Sample the observer over the search space
#
# Sometimes we don't have direct access to the objective function. We only have an observer that indirectly observes it. In _Trieste_, the observer outputs a number of datasets, each of which must be labelled so the optimization process knows which is which. In our case, we only have one dataset, the objective. We'll use _Trieste_'s default label for single-model setups, `OBJECTIVE`. We can convert a function with `branin`'s signature to a single-output observer using `mk_observer`.
#
# The optimization procedure will benefit from having some starting data from the objective function to base its search on. We sample five points from the search space and evaluate them on the observer.

# %%
from trieste.acquisition.rule import OBJECTIVE

observer = trieste.utils.objectives.mk_observer(branin, OBJECTIVE)

num_initial_points = 5
initial_query_points = search_space.sample(num_initial_points)
initial_data = observer(initial_query_points)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model the objective function
#
# The Bayesian optimization procedure estimates the next best points to query by using a probabilistic model of the objective. We'll use Gaussian process regression for this, provided by GPflow. The model will need to be trained on each step as more points are evaluated, so we'll package it with GPflow's Scipy optimizer.
#
# Just like the data output by the observer, the optimization process assumes multiple models, so we'll need to label the model in the same way.

# %%

# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# We can now run the Bayesian optimization loop by defining a `BayesianOptimizer` and calling its `optimize` method.
#
# The optimizer uses an acquisition rule to choose where in the search space to try on each optimization step. We'll use the default acquisition rule, which is Efficient Global Optimization with Expected Improvement.
#
# We'll run the optimizer for fifteen steps.
#
# The optimization loop catches errors so as not to lose progress, which means the optimization loop might not complete and the data from the last step may not exist. Here we'll handle this crudely by asking for the data regardless, using `.try_get_final_datasets()`, which will re-raise the error if one did occur. For a review of how to handle errors systematically, there is a [dedicated tutorial](recovering_from_errors.ipynb). Finally, like the observer, the optimizer outputs labelled datasets, so we'll get the (only) dataset here by indexing with tag `OBJECTIVE`.

# ## Batch-sequential strategy
#
# Sometimes it is practically convenient to query several points at a time. We can do this in `trieste` using a `BatchAcquisitionRule` and a `BatchAcquisitionFunctionBuilder`, that together recommend a number of query points `num_query_points` (instead of one as previously). The optimizer then queries the observer at all these points simultaneously.
# Here we use the `BatchMonteCarloExpectedImprovement` function. Note that this acquisition function is computed using a Monte-Carlo method (so it requires a `sample_size`), but with a reparametrisation trick, which makes it deterministic.
