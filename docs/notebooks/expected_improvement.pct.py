# ## Describe the problem
#
# In this example, we look to find the minimum value of the two-dimensional Branin function over the hypercube $[0, 1]^2$. The Branin function is a popular toy function used in Bayesian optimization literature. Trieste provides a selection of toy functions in `trieste.objectives` package, where besides the functions we also provide their minimizers, minima and search space definitions.
#
# Below we use a version of the Branin function scaled to the hypercube search space. For the Branin we use the predefined search space `BRANIN_SEARCH_SPACE`, but otherwise one would define the search space directly using a `Box` object (illustrated below as well). We also plot contours of the Branin over the search space.

# ## Sample the observer over the search space
#
# Sometimes we don't have direct access to the objective function. We only have an observer that indirectly observes it. In _Trieste_, an observer can output a number of datasets. In our case, we only have one dataset, the objective. We can convert a function with `branin`'s signature to a single-output observer using `mk_observer`.
#
# The optimization procedure will benefit from having some starting data from the objective function to base its search on. We sample a five point space-filling design from the search space and evaluate it with the observer. For continuous search spaces, Trieste supports random, Sobol and Halton initial designs.

# %%
import trieste

num_initial_points = 5
initial_query_points = search_space.sample_sobol(num_initial_points)
initial_data = observer(initial_query_points)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model the objective function
#
# The Bayesian optimization procedure estimates the next best points to query by using a probabilistic model of the objective. We'll use Gaussian Process (GP) regression for this, as provided by GPflow. The model will need to be trained on each step as more points are evaluated, by default it uses GPflow's Scipy optimizer.
#
# The GPflow models cannot be used directly in our Bayesian optimization routines, only through a valid model wrapper. Trieste has wrappers that support several popular models. For instance, `GPR` and `SGPR` models from GPflow have to be used with `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper. These wrappers standardise outputs from all models, deal with preparation of the data and implement additional methods needed for Bayesian optimization. Below we construct a `GPR` model from GPflow and pass it to the `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper. Wrappers as a rule have an `optimizer` argument and potentially some additional model arguments (for example, `num_kernel_samples` as explained below). All arguments except for the model are set to sensible defaults, users will need to look up the wrapper to check how to customize these settings.
#
# Note below that we put priors on the parameters of our GP model's kernel in order to stabilize model fitting. We found the priors below to be highly effective for objective functions defined over the unit hypercube and with an ouput standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. For objective functions with different scaling, other priors will likely be more appropriate. Our fitted model uses the maximum a posteriori estimate of these kernel parameters, as found by optimizing the kernel parameters starting from the best of `num_kernel_samples` random samples from the kernel parameter priors. For illustration we set the `num_kernel_samples` to 100 (default value is 10). If we do not specify kernel priors, then Trieste returns the maximum likelihood estimate of the kernel parameters.

# Constructing a GPflow model can be somewhat involved and take a dozen lines of non-trivial code. Hence, Trieste has build functions for the supported GPflow models. For example, for the GPR model we would use a `build_gpr` model building function, that sets sensible initial parameters and    priors, almost exactly the same as seen above. We have found these settings to be effective in most cases.

# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# We can now run the Bayesian optimization loop by defining a `BayesianOptimizer` and calling its `optimize` method.
#
# The optimizer uses an acquisition rule to choose where in the search space to try on each optimization step. We'll use the default acquisition rule, which is Efficient Global Optimization with Expected Improvement.
#
# We'll run the optimizer for fifteen steps.
#
# The optimization loop catches errors so as not to lose progress, which means the optimization loop might not complete and the data from the last step may not exist. Here we'll handle this crudely by asking for the data regardless, using `.try_get_final_datasets()`, which will re-raise the error if one did occur. For a review of how to handle errors systematically, there is a [dedicated tutorial](recovering_from_errors.ipynb).
