# ## Describe the problem
#
# In this notebook, we show how to perform data transformation during Bayesian optimization. This is usually required by the models. A very common example is normalising the data before fitting the model, either min-max or standard normalization. This is usually done for numerical stability, or to improve or speed up the convergence.
#
# In regression problems it is easy to perform data transformations as you do it once before training. In Bayesian optimization this is more complex, as the data added with each iteration and needs to be transformed as well before the model is updated. At the moment Trieste cannot do such transformations for the user. Luckily, this can be easily done by using the [Ask-Tell interface](ask_tell_optimization.ipynb), as it provides greater control of the optimization loop. The disadvantage is that it is up to the user to take care of all the data transformation.
#
# As an example, we will be searching for a minimum of a 10-dimensional [Trid function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/trid.html). The range of variation of the Trid function values is large. It varies from values of $10^5$ to its global minimum $f(x^∗) = −210$. This large variation range makes it difficult for Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes to find the global minimum. However, with data normalisation it becomes possible (see <cite data-cite="hebbal2019bayesian">[Hebbal et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03350)</cite>).

# ## Collect initial points

# We set up the observer as usual over the Trid function search space, using Sobol sampling to sample the initial points.

# ## Model the objective function
#
# The Bayesian optimization procedure estimates the next best points to query by using a probabilistic model of the objective. We'll use a Gaussian process (GP) model, built using GPflow. The GPflow models cannot be used directly in our Bayesian optimization routines, so we build a GPflow's `GPR` model and pass it to the `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper.
#
# Here as the first example, we model the objective function using the original data, without performing any data transformation. In the next example we will model it using normalised data. We also put priors on the parameters of our GP model's kernel in order to stabilize model fitting. We found the priors below to be highly effective for objective functions defined over the unit hypercube and with an output normalised to have zero mean and unit variance. Since the non-normalised data from the original objective function comes with different scaling, we rescale the priors based on approximate standard deviation of inputs and outputs.

# ## Run the optimization loop
#
# We can now run the Bayesian optimization loop by defining a `BayesianOptimizer` and calling its `optimize` method.
#
# The optimizer uses an acquisition rule to choose where in the search space to try on each optimization step. We'll be using Expected improvement acquisition function - it is used by default, so no need to specify it.
#
# We'll run the optimizer for 100 steps. Note: this may take a while!

# We can now get the best point found by the optimizer. Note this isn't necessarily the point that was last evaluated. We will also plot regret for each optimization step.
