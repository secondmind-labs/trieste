# # Asynchronous Bayesian optimization with Trieste
#
# In this notebook we demonstrate Trieste's ability to perform asynchronous Bayesian optimisation, as is suitable for scenarios where the objective function can be run for several points in parallel but where observations might return back at different times. To avoid wasting resources waiting for the evaluation of the whole batch, we immediately request the next point asynchronously, taking into account points that are still being evaluated. Besides saving resources, asynchronous approach also can potentially [improve sample efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10452) in comparison with synchronous batch strategies, although this is highly dependent on the use case.
#
# To contrast this approach with regular [batch optimization](batch_optimization.ipynb), this notebook also shows how to run parallel synchronous batch approach.

# First, let's define a simple objective that will emulate evaluations taking variable time. We will be using a classic Bayesian optimisation benchmark function [Branin](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/branin.html) with a sleep call inserted in the middle of the calculation to emulate delay. Our sleep delay is a scaled sum of all input values to make sure delays are uneven.

# ## Multiprocessing setup
#
# To keep this notebook as reproducible as possible, we will only be using Python's multiprocessing package here. In this section we will explain our setup and define some common code to be used later.
#
# In both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios we will have a fixed set of worker processes performing observations. We will also have a main process responsible for optimization process with Trieste. When Trieste suggests a new point, it is inserted into a points queue. One of the workers picks this point from the queue, performs the observation, and inserts the output into the observations queue. The main process then picks up the observation from the queue, at which moment it either waits for the rest of the points in the batch to come back (synchronous scenario) or immediately suggests a new point (asynchronous scenario). This process continues either for a certain number of iterations or until we accumulate necessary number of observations.
#
# The overall setup is illustrated in this diagram:
# ![multiprocessing setup](figures/async_bo.png)

# %%
# Necessary multiprocessing primitives
from multiprocessing import Manager, Process

# %% [markdown]
# We now define several common functions to implement the described setup. First we define a worker function that will be running a single observation in a separate process. Worker takes both queues as an input, reads next point from the points queue, makes an observation, and inserts observed data into the observations queue.

        print(f"Process {pid}: Observer : observed data {new_data}", flush=True)

        observations_queue.put(new_data)


# %% [markdown]
# Next we define two helper functions, one is to create a certain number of worker processes, and another is to terminate them once we are done.

# ## Asynchronous optimization
# This section runs the asynchronous optimization routine. We first setup the [ask/tell optimizer](ask_tell_optimization.ipynb) as we cannot hand over the evaluation of the objective to Trieste. Next we create thread-safe queues for points and observations, and run the optimization loop.
#
# Crucially, even though we are using batch acquisition function Local Penalization, we specify batch size of 1. This is because we don't really want a batch. Since the amount of workers we have is fixed, whenever we see a new observation we only need one point back. However this process can only be done with acquisition functions that implement greedy batch collection strategies, because they are able to take into account points that are currently being observed (in Trieste we call them "pending"). Trieste currently provides two such functions: Local Penalization and GIBBON. Notice that we use **AsynchronousGreedy** rule specifically designed for using greedy batch acquisition functions in asynchronous scenarios.

# This section runs the synchronous parallel optimization with Trieste. We again use Local Penalization acquisition function, but this time with batch size equal to the number of workers we have available. Once Trieste suggests the batch, we add all points to the point queue, and workers immediatelly pick them up, one point per worker. Therefore all points in the batch are evaluated in parallel.
