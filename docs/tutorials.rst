Run the tutorials interactively
-------------------------------

The above tutorials are built from Jupytext notebooks in the notebooks directory of the repository. These notebooks can also be run interactively. To do so, install the library from sources, along with additional notebook dependencies, with (in the repository root)

.. code::

   $ pip install . -r notebooks/requirements.txt

then run

.. code::

   $ jupyter-notebook notebooks
