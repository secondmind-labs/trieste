Trieste documentation
=====================

Trieste is a research toolbox built on `TensorFlow <http://www.tensorflow.org/>`_, dedicated to Bayesian optimization, the process of finding the optimal values of an expensive, black-box objective function by employing probabilistic models over observations.

Without loss of generality, Trieste only supports minimizing the
objective function. In the simplest case of an objective function with one-dimensional real
output :math:`f: X \mapsto \mathbb R`, this is

.. math:: \mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}_{x \in X} f(x) \qquad .

When the objective function has higher-dimensional output, we can still talk of finding the minima,
though the optimal values will form a Pareto set rather than a single point. Trieste provides
functionality for optimization of single-valued objective functions, and supports extension to the
higher-dimensional case. It also supports optimization over constrained spaces, learning the
constraints alongside the objective.

Trieste (pronounced *tree-est*) is named after the bathyscaphe `Trieste <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste_(bathyscaphe)>`_, the first vehicle to take a crew to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the lowest point on the Earth's surface: the literal global minimum.

Installation
------------

To install Trieste, run

.. code::

   $ pip install trieste

The library supports Python 3.7 onwards, and uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
