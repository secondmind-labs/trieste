=======================================================

.. py:module:: trieste.acquisition.multi_objective.partition

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains functions of different methods for
   partitioning the dominated/non-dominated region in multi-objective optimization problems.



Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: prepare_default_non_dominated_partition_bounds(reference: trieste.types.TensorType, observations: Optional[trieste.types.TensorType] = None, anti_reference: Optional[trieste.types.TensorType] = None) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

   Prepare the default non-dominated partition boundary for acquisition function usage.
   This functionality will trigger different partition according to objective numbers, if
   objective number is 2, an `ExactPartition2dNonDominated` will be used. If the objective
   number is larger than 2, a `DividedAndConquerNonDominated` will be used.

   :param observations: The observations for all objectives, with shape [N, D], if not specified
       or is an empty Tensor, a single non-dominated partition bounds constructed by reference
       and anti_reference point will be returned.
   :param anti_reference: a worst point to use with shape [D].
       Defines the lower bound of the hypercell. If not specified, will use a default value:
       -[1e10] * D.
   :param reference: a reference point to use, with shape [D].
       Defines the upper bound of the hypervolume.
       Should be equal to or bigger than the anti-ideal point of the Pareto set.
       For comparing results across runs, the same reference point must be used.
   :return: lower, upper bounds of the partitioned cell, each with shape [N, D]
   :raise ValueError (or `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`): If ``reference`` has an invalid
       shape.
   :raise ValueError (or `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`): If ``anti_reference`` has an invalid
       shape.


.. py:class:: _BoundIndexPartition

   A collection of partition strategies that are based on storing the index of pareto fronts
   & other auxiliary points

   .. py:method:: partition_bounds(self, anti_reference: trieste.types.TensorType, reference: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      Get the partitioned hypercell's lower and upper bounds.

      :param anti_reference: a worst point to use with shape [D].
          Defines the lower bound of the hypercell
      :param reference: a reference point to use, with shape [D].
          Defines the upper bound of the hypervolume.
          Should be equal to or bigger than the anti-ideal point of the Pareto set.
          For comparing results across runs, the same reference point must be used.
      :return: lower, upper bounds of the partitioned cell, each with shape [N, D]
      :raise ValueError (or `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`): If ``reference`` has an invalid
          shape.



.. py:class:: ExactPartition2dNonDominated(front: trieste.types.TensorType)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_BoundIndexPartition`

   Exact partition of non-dominated space, used as a default option when the
   objective number equals 2.

   :param front: non-dominated pareto front.


.. py:class:: DividedAndConquerNonDominated(front: trieste.types.TensorType, threshold: TensorType | float = 0)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_BoundIndexPartition`

   branch and bound procedure algorithm. a divide and conquer method introduced
   in :cite:`Couckuyt2012`.

   :param front: non-dominated pareto front.
   :param threshold: a threshold used to screen out cells in partition : when its volume is
       below this threshold, its rejected directly in order to be more computationally
       efficient, if setting above 0, this partition strategy tends to return an
       approximated partition.
