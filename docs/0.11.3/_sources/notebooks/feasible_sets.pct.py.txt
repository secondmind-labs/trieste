# # Bayesian active learning of failure or feasibility regions
#
# When designing a system it is important to identify design parameters that may affect the reliability of the system and cause failures, or lead to unsatisfactory performance. Consider designing a communication network that for some design parameters would lead to too long delays for users. A designer of the system would then decide what is the maximum acceptable delay and want to identify a *failure region* in the parameter space that would lead to longer delays., or conversely, a *feasible region* with safe performance.
#
# When evaluating the system is expensive (e.g. lengthy computer simulations), identification of the failure region needs to be performed with a limited number of evaluations. Traditional Monte Carlo based methods are not suitable here as they require too many evaluations. Bayesian active learning methods, however, are well suited for the task. Here we show how Trieste can be used to identify failure or feasible regions with the help of acquisition functions designed with this goal in mind.

# ## A toy problem
#
# Throughout the tutorial we will use the standard Branin function as a stand-in for an expensive-to-evaluate system. We create a failure region by thresholding the value at 80, space with value above 80 is considered a failure region. This region needs to be learned as efficiently as possible by the active learning algorithm.
#
# Note that if we are interested in a feasibility region instead, it is simply a complement of the failure region, space with the value below 80.
#
# We illustrate the thresholded Branin function below, you can note that above the threshold of 80 there are no more values observed.

# ## Probabilistic model of the objective function
#
# Just like in sequential optimization, we use a probabilistic model of the objective function. Acquisition functions will exploit the predictive posterior of the model to identify the failure region. The GPflow models cannot be used directly in our Bayesian optimization routines, so we build a GPflow's `GPR` model using Trieste's convenient model build function `build_gpr` and pass it to the `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper. Note that we set the likelihood variance to a small number because we are dealing with a noise-free problem.

# %%
import gpflow
from trieste.models.gpflow import GaussianProcessRegression, build_gpr


gpflow_model = build_gpr(initial_data, search_space, likelihood_variance=1e-7)

# ## Active learning with Expected feasibility acquisition function
#
# The problem of identifying a failure or feasibility region of a (expensive-to-evaluate) function $f$ can be formalized as estimating the excursion set, $\Gamma^* = \{ x \in X: f(x) \ge T\}$, or estimating the contour line, $C^* = \{ x \in X: f(x) = T\}$, for some threshold $T$ (see <cite data-cite="bect2012sequential"/> for more details).
#
# It turns out that Gaussian processes can be used as classifiers for identifying where excursion probability is larger than 1/2 and this idea is used to build many sequential sampling strategies. Here we introduce Expected feasibility acquisition function that implements two related sampling strategies called *bichon* criterion (<cite data-cite="bichon2008efficient"/>) and *ranjan* criterion (<cite data-cite="ranjan2008sequential"/>). <cite data-cite="bect2012sequential"/> provides a common expression for these two criteria: $$\mathbb{E}[\max(0, (\alpha s(x))^\delta - |T - m(x)|^\delta)]$$
#
# Here $m(x)$ and $s(x)$ are the mean and standard deviation of the predictive posterior of the Gaussian process model. Bichon criterion is obtained when $\delta = 1$ while ranjan criterion is obtained when $\delta = 2$. $\alpha>0$ is another parameter that acts as a percentage of standard deviation of the posterior around the current boundary estimate where we want to sample. The goal is to sample a point with a mean close to the threshold $T$ and a high variance, so that the positive difference in the equation above is as large as possible.


# %% [markdown]
# We now illustrate `ExpectedFeasibility` acquisition function using the Bichon criterion. Performance for the Ranjan criterion is typically very similar. `ExpectedFeasibility` takes threshold as an input and has two parameters, `alpha` and `delta` following the description above.
#
# Note that even though we use below `ExpectedFeasibility` with `EfficientGlobalOptimization`  `BayesianOptimizer` routine, we are actually performing active learning. The only relevant difference between the two is the nature of the acquisition function - optimization ones are designed with the goal of finding the optimum of a function, while active learning ones are designed to learn the function (or some aspect of it, like here).

# Let's illustrate the results.
#
# To identify the failure or feasibility region we compute the excursion probability using our Gaussian process model: $$P\left(\frac{m(x) - T}{s(x)}\right)$$ where $m(x)$ and $s(x)$ are the mean and standard deviation of the predictive posterior of the model given the data.
#
# We plot a two-dimensional contour map of our thresholded Branin function as a reference, excursion probability map using the model fitted to the initial data alone, and updated excursion probability map after all the active learning steps.
#
# We first define helper functions for computing excursion probabilities and plotting, and then plot the thresholded Branin function as a reference. White area represents the failure region.

# ## Active learning with Integrated Variance Reduction acquisition function
#
# An alternative to the `ExpectedFeasibility` acquisition function is called `IntegratedVarianceReduction`. This acquisition has the advantage of taking into account reduction of uncertainty in a region of the search space when choosing the next point to sample, instead of considering only the sampling point. This makes it more expensive to compute than `ExpectedFeasibility`, since it involves computing an integral over a set of integration points. This integration region is determined by the user, with the `integration_points` parameter. Another advantage is that `IntegratedVarianceReduction` can produce batches of points, which becomes useful when parallel evaluations are possible.
#
# Below we perform 10 active learning steps of batch size 2, with `IntegratedVarianceReduction` acquisition function and same as above plot excursion probability of the final model.

# One can also specify a range of thresholds rather than a single value. We can do this by specifying a range with a minimum and a maximum threshold, rather than a single threshold as the `threshold` parameter. The resulting query points are likely to be more spread out than previously, as now the whole region between the thresholds is aimed to be well estimated, rather than a single line.

# We can now illustrate the probability that a point in the search space belongs to the threshold interval rather than the probability that points exceed a single threshold. We compare probability maps obtained with the `IntegratedVarianceReduction` (IVR) when optimising for the threshold range and for the single threshold at the center of the range, as well as to a probability map for the `ExpectedFeasibility` function obtained with a single threshold. As expected, the `IntegratedVarianceReduction` with threshold range spreads query points a bit more, which leads to a sharper probability boundary.
