.. py:module:: trieste.acquisition.multi_objective.dominance

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains functionality for computing the non-dominated set
   given a set of data points.

---------------

.. py:function:: non_dominated(observations: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

   Computes the non-dominated set for a set of data points.
   If there are duplicate point(s) in the non-dominated set, this function will return
   as it is without removing the duplicate.

   :param observations: set of points with shape [N,D]
   :return: tf.Tensor of the non-dominated set [P,D] and the degree of dominance [N],
       P is the number of points in pareto front dominances gives the number of
       dominating points for each data point
