# ## Describe the problem
#
# In this example, we consider the same problem presented in our [EI notebook](expected_improvement.ipynb), i.e. seeking the minimizer of the two-dimensional Branin function, but with input constraints.
#
# There are 3 linear constraints with respective lower/upper limits (i.e. 6 linear inequality constraints). There are 2 non-linear constraints with respective lower/upper limits (i.e. 4 non-linear inequality constraints).
#
# We begin our optimization after collecting five function evaluations from random locations in the search space.

# ## Surrogate model
#
# We fit a surrogate Gaussian process model to the initial data. The GPflow models cannot be used directly in our Bayesian optimization routines, so we build a GPflow's `GPR` model using Trieste's convenient model build function `build_gpr` and pass it to the `GaussianProcessRegression` wrapper. Note that we set the likelihood variance to a small number because we are dealing with a noise-free problem.

# ## Constrained optimization method
#
# ### Acquisition function (constrained optimization)
#
# We can construct the _expected improvement_ acquisition function as usual. However, in order for the acquisition function to handle the constraints, the constrained search space must be passed as a constructor argument. Without the constrained search space, the acquisition function would be unconstrained _expected improvement_.

# ### Run the optimization loop (constrained optimization)
#

# ## Penalty method
#
# ### Acquisition function (penalty method)
#
# We recommend using the constrained optimization method above for cases where it can be used, as it should be more efficient. However there are setups when that method cannot be used, e.g. when using batches and some acquisition functions. For such cases, an alternative is to construct the standard _expected constrained improvement_ (similar to the [inequality-constraints notebook](inequality_constraints.ipynb)); except instead of using probability of feasibility with respect to the constraint model, we construct feasibility from the explicit input constraints. This feasibility is calculated by passing all the constraints residuals (to their respective limits) through a smooth step function and taking the product.
#
# For this method, the `FastConstraintsFeasibility` class should be passed constraints via the search space. `ExpectedConstrainedImprovement` and `BayesianOptimizer` should be set up as usual without the constrained search space.
#
# Note: this method penalises the expected improvement acquisition outside the feasible region. The optimizer uses the default _scipy_ _L-BFGS-B_ method to find the max of the acquistion function.
