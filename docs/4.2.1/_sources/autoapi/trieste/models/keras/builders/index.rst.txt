=============================

.. py:module:: trieste.models.keras.builders

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This file contains builders for Keras models supported in Trieste. We found the default
   configurations used here to work well in most situation, but they should not be taken as
   universally good solutions.

.. py:function:: build_keras_ensemble(data: trieste.data.Dataset, ensemble_size: int = 5, num_hidden_layers: int = 2, units: int = 25, activation: Union[str, gpflow.keras.tf_keras.layers.Activation] = 'relu', independent_normal: bool = False) -> trieste.models.keras.architectures.KerasEnsemble

   Builds a simple ensemble of neural networks in Keras where each network has the same
   architecture: number of hidden layers, nodes in hidden layers and activation function.

   Default ensemble size and activation function seem to work well in practice, in regression type
   of problems at least. Number of hidden layers and units per layer should be modified according
   to the dataset size and complexity of the function - the default values seem to work well
   for small datasets common in Bayesian optimization. Using the independent normal is relevant
   only if one is modelling multiple output variables, as it simplifies the distribution by
   ignoring correlations between outputs.

   :param data: Data for training, used for extracting input and output tensor specifications.
   :param ensemble_size: The size of the ensemble, that is, the number of base learners or
       individual neural networks in the ensemble.
   :param num_hidden_layers: The number of hidden layers in each network.
   :param units: The number of nodes in each hidden layer.
   :param activation: The activation function in each hidden layer.
   :param independent_normal: If set to `True` then :class:`~tfp.layers.IndependentNormal` layer
       is used as the output layer. This models outputs as independent, only the diagonal
       elements of the covariance matrix are parametrized. If left as the default `False`,
       then :class:`~tfp.layers.MultivariateNormalTriL` layer is used where correlations
       between outputs are learned as well. Note that this is only relevant for multi-output
       models.
   :return: Keras ensemble model.
