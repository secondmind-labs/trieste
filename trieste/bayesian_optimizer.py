        Attempt to find the minimizer of the ``observer`` in the ``search_space`` (both specified at
        :meth:`__init__`). This is the central implementation of the Bayesian optimization loop.

        For each step in ``num_steps``, this method:
            - Finds the next points with which to query the ``observer`` using the
              ``acquisition_rule``'s :meth:`acquire` method, passing it the ``search_space``,
              ``datasets``, models built from the ``model_specs``, and current acquisition state.
            - Queries the ``observer`` *once* at those points.
            - Updates the datasets and models with the data from the ``observer``.

        If any errors are raised during the optimization loop, this method will catch and return
        them instead, along with the history of the optimization process, and print a message (using
        `absl` at level `logging.ERROR`).

        **Note:** While the :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel` interface implies
        mutable models, it is *not* guaranteed that the model passed to :meth:`optimize` will
        be updated during the optimization process. For example, if ``track_state`` is `True`, a
        copied model will be used on each optimization step. Use the models in the return value for
        reliable access to the updated models.

        **Type hints:**
            - The ``acquisition_rule`` must use the same type of
              :class:`~trieste.space.SearchSpace` as specified in :meth:`__init__`.
            - The ``acquisition_state`` must be of the type expected by the ``acquisition_rule``.
              Any acquisition state in the optimization result will also be of this type.

        :param num_steps: The number of optimization steps to run.
        :param datasets: The known observer query points and observations for each tag.
        :param model_specs: The model to use for each :class:`~trieste.data.Dataset` in
            ``datasets``.
        :param acquisition_rule: The acquisition rule, which defines how to search for a new point
            on each optimization step. Defaults to
            :class:`~trieste.acquisition.rule.EfficientGlobalOptimization` with default
            arguments. Note that if the default is used, this implies the tags must be
            `OBJECTIVE`, the search space can be any :class:`~trieste.space.SearchSpace`, and the
            acquisition state returned in the :class:`OptimizationResult` will be `None`.
        :param acquisition_state: The acquisition state to use on the first optimization step.
            This argument allows the caller to restore the optimization process from an existing
            :class:`Record`.
        :param track_state: If `True`, this method saves the optimization state at the start of each
            step. Models and acquisition state are copied using `copy.deepcopy`.
        :return: An :class:`OptimizationResult`. The :attr:`final_result` element contains either
            the final optimization data, models and acquisition state, or, if an exception was
            raised while executing the optimization loop, it contains the exception raised. In
            either case, the :attr:`history` element is the history of the data, models and
            acquisition state at the *start* of each optimization step (up to and including any step
            that fails to complete). The history will never include the final optimization result.
