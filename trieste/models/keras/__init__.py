This package contains the primary interface for deep neural network models. It also contains a
number of :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel` wrappers for neural network models. Note that
currently copying/saving models is not supported, so when
:class:`~trieste.bayesian_optimizer.BayesianOptimizer` is used ``track_state`` should be set
to `False`.
