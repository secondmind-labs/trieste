    A :class:`~trieste.model.TrainableProbabilisticModel` wrapper for deep ensembles built using
    Keras.

    Deep ensembles are ensembles of deep neural networks that have been found to have good
    representation of uncertainty in practice (<cite data-cite="lakshminarayanan2017simple"/>).
    This makes them a potentially attractive model for Bayesian optimization for use-cases with
    large number of observations, non-stationary objective functions and need for fast predictions,
    in which standard Gaussian process models are likely to struggle. The model consists of simple
    fully connected multilayer probabilistic networks as base learners, with Gaussian distribution
    as a final layer, using the negative log-likelihood loss for training the networks. The
    model relies on differences in random initialization of weights for generating diversity among
    base learners.

    The original formulation of the model does not include boostrapping of the data. The authors
    found that it does not improve performance the model. We include bootstrapping as an option
    as later work that more precisely measured uncertainty quantification found that boostrapping
    does help with uncertainty representation (see <cite data-cite="osband2021epistemic"/>).

    We provide classes for constructing ensembles using Keras
    (:class:`~trieste.models.keras.KerasEnsemble`) in the `architectures` package that should be
    used with the :class:`~trieste.models.keras.DeepEnsemble` wrapper. There we also provide a
    :class:`~trieste.models.keras.GaussianNetwork` base learner following the original
    formulation in <cite data-cite="lakshminarayanan2017simple"/>, but any user-specified network
    can be supplied, as long as it has a Gaussian distribution as a final layer and follows the
    :class:`~trieste.models.keras.KerasEnsembleNetwork` interface.

    A word of caution in case a learning rate scheduler is used in ``fit_args`` to
    :class:`KerasOptimizer` optimizer instance. Typically one would not want to continue with the
    reduced learning rate in the subsequent Bayesian optimization step. Hence, we reset the
    learning rate to the original one after calling the ``fit`` method. In case this is not the
    behaviour you would like, you will need to subclass the model and overwrite the
    :meth:`optimize` method.

    Currently, we do not support setting up the model with dictionary config.
