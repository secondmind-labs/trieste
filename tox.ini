# TODO: migrate docs builds to 3.10 after working around the following issues:
# 1. we currently pin sphinx to 3.5.4 to work around
# https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/4563, but that version breaks with Python 3.10
# 2. we currently pin pandas to <1.0.0 (and rely on it), which similarly breaks with Pytho 3.10
# 3. we depend on box2d, which doesn't provide wheels for Python 3.10 or a source package
# see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70323852/error-trying-to-install-python-package-box2d
